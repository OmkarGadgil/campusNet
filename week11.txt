In this week while testing i noticed i had error connecting with the database at Mlabs because of the changes made in the package.json file and the config file for the data base.

The solution to it was changing the mongoid in the config file for the server connection and also updating the node module package.json for necessary changes.

Forums like stack overflow and and the mongodb community help me resolve this specific issue.
