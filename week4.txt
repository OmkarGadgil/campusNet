Week 4 report
In this week I have worked on other angular components such as the events, views and layout.
I have added the form to create the user profile, made some UI changes to the homepage, added a rating page.
Problems faced: for creating the user profiles I had to learn the angular elements and understand the export component functionality of the framework.
