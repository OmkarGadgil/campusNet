In this last week i deployed the entire code along with the necessary API on heroku server.

Heroku makes it easy for automatic update deployment because of its Git integration in the pipeline.

During deployment for the server code i came across version issues for the angular framework and some libraries in the ng module.

The solution was to update the angular cli, clear the npm cache and then redeploy the code on server.

API code was pushed to a seperate repository for server.
