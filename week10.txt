In this week I Worked on the testing of the application developed.
For testing purpose I used Postman API services.
The testing was done for the authentication, events creation, tickets generation, reviews.
POST method was utilized to insert into the database which is hosted on the Mlabs server.
JWT token generation was tested for its payload value and bearer token id from POSTMAN app.

Problems Faced: There was authentication issue with the user creation.

Solution: It was found that the mongoid hosted on the Server had access rights issue. necessary permission were granted after which the user creation was successful.

Following resources were useful for this.
